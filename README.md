Badger is a web application that generates consistent styled project badges
with data from various services such as [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org). It is
heavily inspired by [shields.io](https://github.com/badges/shields/).

This is a very early work in progress, the badge styles and/or API endpoints
may change until the first `1.x.x` release.

Contributions are welcome, don't be shy :)
